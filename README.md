## Description
**MossyLib** is a simple library that has all the common code for my mods. It really makes it easier and faster for me to develop mods.

### What it has:
- Special YACL theme for my mods
- Utilities
- Ready-made multi-versioned & multi-loadered code (to support Fabric and (Neo)Forge)
